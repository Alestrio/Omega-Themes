# What is Omega-Themes

Omega-themes is the theme engine of [Omega](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega), an extension to Numworks' Epsilon, the OS that runs on their calculator, which brings many features to it.
This theme engine applies colors, which comes from the .json files in [themes folder](https://github.com/RedGl0w/Omega-Themes/tree/master/themes). 
You can share your themes via the issues, and maybe get integrated. In the future, the user'll be able to give a `username/repositoryname` to automaticaly download unofficial themes.

# TO-DO

* Create the `username/repositoryname` system
* Create a web page to create and see a theme, without having to compil
* Create a color-blind theme
