## About

Omega-Themes `BETA` is the theme engine of [Omega](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega), an extension to Numworks' Epsilon. This engine allows you to change the theme of Omega easily before installing the OS.

## Installation

First of all, follow the installation guide of Omega [here](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega), but stop right before the `make clean` command. Then, execute this:

```
cd themes
python themes_manager.py
```

(Note: tkinter should be installed to run this command)

Now, a window should be opened. Follow the instructions. Then, go back on the Omega folder with `cd ..` and finish the installation guide of Omega.

## An idea of theme?

- Don't hesitate to open an issue if you have any ideas.
- Soon, you'll be able to create your own themes repositories. We're working on this feature.
