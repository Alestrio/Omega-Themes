## About

Omega-Themes `BETA` is the theme engine of [Omega](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega), an extension to Numworks' Epsilon. This engine allows you to change the theme of Omega easily before installing the OS.

## Installation

First of all, follow the installation guide of Omega [here](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega), but stop right before the `make clean` command. Then, execute this:

```
cd themes
python themes_manager.py <name_of_the_theme>
```

To know the available themes, execute the following command: `python themes_manager.py -l`.

Then, go back to the Omega folder with `cd ..` and finish the installation guide of Omega.

## An idea of theme?
